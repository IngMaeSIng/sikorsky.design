    <h1 id="title">My Experience with the reMarkable Paper Pro, a Tool for Slow Productivity</h1>
    <h2>
        Two months ago, I bought <a href="https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro" class="link" target="_blank">a reMarkable Paper Pro</a>. After years inside Apple’s comfortable ecosystem, I wanted to try something different: a device built for a calmer, more focused way to read, write, and design. Before that, I used an iPad for those same tasks, but often got sidetracked by the occasional mindless Fallout Shelter session.

    <h2>User experience: 9/10</h2>
    <p>
      This device is made for two things — reading and writing, and nothing else.  
      No distractions, just the two jobs that actually matter to me. I love that. I take it everywhere now, instead of carrying a          separate book and notebook.
    </p>

      It loads slowly, you can almost _feel_ it thinking under the hood. It’s annoying, but in a strange way, that delay grounds           you. It sets the pace for calm, focused work. You stop rushing, stop switching. You just do one thing, thoughtfully.

    <h2>Screen: 8/10</h2>
    <p>
      At first, it feels unusually dim, even at maximum brightness. Years of doomscrolling on OLEDs have probably burned my retina’s       expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, it’s great for reading outside, even in bright sunlight, and surprisingly comfortable to read in bed at night.
    </p>

      There are eight highlight colors besides black. All of them dull.

    <h2>Writing Experience: 9/10</h2>
    <div class="paragraph-with-list-block">

      Writing feels great, noticeably better than on the iPad. Of course, it’s still not paper, but the advantages are clear:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In paper notebooks I always write neat to save pages. Quick sketches end up on loose sheets anyway. They pile up, get lost,          and are a pain to store.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the reMarkable, it feels good to make rough drafts and write messily. Everything stays saved, and there’s no fear of              losing anything.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are several pen types, underlining options, an eraser on the back of the stylus, and handy gesture shortcuts.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can select and move written parts around when you realize something doesn’t fit.
      </li>
      <li>
        It recognizes handwritten English and some other languages, but not Russian (yet).
      </li>
    </ul>
