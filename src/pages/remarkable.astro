      My Experience with the reMarkable Paper Pro, a Tool for Slow Productivity
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Two months ago, I bought <a
        href="https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro"
        class="link"
        target="_blank">a reMarkable Paper Pro</a
      >. After years inside Apple’s comfortable ecosystem, I wanted to try
      something different: a device built for a calmer, more focused way to
      read, write, and design. Before that, I used an iPad for those same tasks,
      but often got sidetracked by the occasional mindless Fallout Shelter
      session.

    <h2>User experience: 9/10</h2>
    <p>
      This device is made for two things — reading and writing, and nothing
      else. No distractions, just the two jobs that actually matter to me. I
      love that. I take it everywhere now, instead of carrying a separate book
      and notebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      It loads slowly, you can almost _feel_ it thinking under the hood. It’s
      annoying, but in a strange way, that delay grounds you. It sets the pace
      for calm, focused work. You stop rushing, stop switching. You just do one
      thing, thoughtfully.
    </p>

    <h2>Screen: 8/10</h2>
    <p>
      At first, it feels unusually dim, even at maximum brightness. Years of
      doomscrolling on OLEDs have probably burned my retina’s expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, it’s great for reading outside, even in bright sunlight, and
      surprisingly comfortable to read in bed at night.
    </p>
    <p>There are eight highlight colors besides black. All of them dull.</p>

    <h2>Writing Experience: 9/10</h2>
    <p>
      Writing feels great, noticeably better than on the iPad. Of course, it’s still not paper, but the advantages are clear:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In paper notebooks I always write neat to save pages. Quick sketches end up on loose sheets anyway. They pile up, get lost,          and are a pain to store.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the reMarkable, it feels good to make rough drafts and write messily. Everything stays saved, and there’s no fear of              losing anything.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are several pen types, underlining options, an eraser on the back of the stylus, and handy gesture shortcuts.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can select and move written parts around when you realize something doesn’t fit.
      </li>
      <li>
        It recognizes handwritten English and some other languages, but not Russian (yet).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>File Storage: 5/10</h2>
    <p>
      The system inside is pretty standard: you create folders inside folders inside more folders. There are tags, favorites, and          filters for different e-book formats. It’s easy to use, but not great for building a knowledge base.
    </p>
    <p>
      My flow looks like this: I write on the tablet, then manually move the important notes into <a href="https://t.me/initsrightplace/215" class="link" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://t.me/initsrightplace/165"   class="link" target="_blank">Notion</a>, or <a href="https://t.me/initsrightplace/223" class="link" target="_blank">my journal</a>.         That’s also when I do the first round of editing. It works for me, writing and editing are two separate rhythms that don’t overlap.
