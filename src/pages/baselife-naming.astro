    <p>I’ve been journaling every day for the past 11 years.</p>
    <p>I started in Evernote, then moved to Griddiary. Along the way, I tried dozens of productivity tools to enhance my practice: Trello, Things 3, Notes, Notion, Obsidian, Kin, Timestripe, Habit, Momentum, How We Feel, Joi Planner, Purpose, Atoms, Lid, Amie, custom Google Sheets plus plenty of paper journals with different frameworks.</p>
    <p>Each was good at solving a specific problem. But none of them gave me a clear visual structure that showed how using them actually shaped my life.</p>
    <p>That’s when the idea of building my own product began to form in my designer’s mind. Something that would bring different practices together around a life calendar.</p>
    <p>I came up with the name Baseline after watching the latest Blade Runner. You might remember the scene where Gosling’s character recalibrates his emotional state in a white room. That image stuck with me. It felt like a perfect metaphor for journaling: a tool to level your emotions in the present moment.</p>
    <p>For a couple of years, I lived with that idea, refining the framework and testing practices that could form a more complete journaling experience.</p>
    <p>Then, in early January, I finally decided to register a domain name.</p>
    <p>As expected, all the good ones were taken. I also discovered two similar products already using the same name. That was my first real collision with reality, and it broke the idea.</p>
    <p>I spent two days frustrated. Then I managed to look at the situation differently.</p>
    <p>Baseline sounds like a technical term. It lacks emotion and doesn’t fully express the depth of the idea. It would be hard to build a memorable brand on top of it.</p>
    <p>So I started exploring alternatives. My shortlist included Holos, Holist, LifeCore, Wholen, and Lifelog.</p>
    <p>In the end, I changed just one letter and landed on Baselife.</p>
    <p>The word doesn’t exist, but its two parts capture the idea completely. A base for life resonates perfectly with me.</p>
    <p>At some point, it clicked: a good brand isn’t about a perfect name. It’s a story you’re willing to tell consistently over time, until people get used to it and stop finding it strange.</p>
    <p>Now I say the name out loud regularly and enjoy how it sounds, clear and alive.</p>
