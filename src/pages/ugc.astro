    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Avito is a leading classified platform, offering ads for goods,
      transportation, real estate, jobs, and services from both individuals and
      businesses. Since 2021, it <a
        href="https://www.similarweb.com/ru/website/avito.ru/#overview"
        target="_blank"
        class="link">has become the world's most visited classified</a
      >, surpassing Craigslist in daily active users (DAU), with over <strong
        >42M registered users</strong
      > and <strong>150M listings</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, with increasing popularity, companies like Yandex and Yula
      launched competing services, focusing on a more refined content approach.
      This posed a risk of user churn, making it critical to enhance the quality
      of Avito's content while maintaining the growing volume of listings.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this challenge, we initiated the "Content Quality" product
      stream. Over three years, we conducted a comprehensive research, ran a
      dozen experiments, defined high-quality content and developed strategies
      to encourage users to create better listings.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Growing the number of listings is straightforward. You fix the posting
      flow funnel: refine critical steps to improve conversion rate, and pour
      more traffic at the top. A clear metric and approach to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, what constitutes quality is not as clear. On an empirical level,
      we know that a listing should have many good photos, a detailed
      description, and filled-out parameters. The question is how to quantify
      this into a usable metric.
    </p>
    <p>
      This challenge is compounded by the fact that posting flow varies across
      categories and platforms, containing different parameters and even
      features. Additionally, more and more designers are joining business
      verticals and contributing to the posting flow, further extending the
      information model and adding new services.
    </p>

    <h2>Issues with UGC</h2>
    <p>
      We organized a workshop to capture a wide range of viewpoints on the
      issue, bringing together designers, researchers, and product managers from
      all the business verticals.

    </p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      A significant portion of our content (over 30%) is contributed by private
      sellers, often resulting in listings that lack visual appeal. This
      inconsistent quality reinforces a perception of the platform as a flea
      market.
    </blockquote>

  <section>
    <h2>Product vision</h2>
    <p>
      Content influences the perception of a platform, but the platform can also
      influence the type of content displayed on it. Our strategic goal was to
      move towards content similar to Airbnb's, in order to attract a new,
      younger audience of buyers, followed by new professional sellers, and to
      justify investments in developing new services for them.

    <h2>Product research findings</h2>
    <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
    <p>
      My team and I researched similar platforms and examined how they work with
      UGC. We didn't find any groundbreaking technologies. Everyone had some
      combination of content guides, static prompts in the interface, and simple
      AI models for improving photos and descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <Image src={ugc4} alt="Competitive analysis" class="image full" />
      <span class="caption secondary">Competitive analysis</span>
    </p>
    <h3>User interviews</h3>
    <p>
      We regularly spoke with users across all segments and compiled a list of
      issues that prevent them from creating quality content:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Beginners have no idea what content is required of them.</li>
      <li>
        Experienced users do not want to spend a lot of time filling out
        listings.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are frustrated by having to manually select the category for their
        listing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users dislike that the form does not remember recurring parameters such
        as phone number and addresses.
      </li>
      <li>
        People are unsure what to write in the description after filling in
        numerous parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are not sure how to take photos and what is important to show.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      The key idea is that users do not care about the process of filling out a
      listing. It has no intrinsic value and merely serves as an obstacle to
      their ultimate goal — selling their goods or services. Therefore, it
      should be as simple and unobtrusive as possible.
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Analytical approach</h2>
    <p>
      To digitize the content quality metric, we came up with <strong
        >a hypothesis that listings with good content should have higher
        liquidity</strong
      >. To test this, we conducted a buyer experiment, comparing similar
      products with different content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results surprised us. It turned out that listings with poor content
      sold better; they had a 25% higher click-through rate (CTR). We explained
      this by the fact that users got used to buying used items from private
      sellers, often ignoring the professional content created by pro sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on this experiment, we developed a holistic metric for quality
      content. It varied by category, but generally included the following
      criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Correctly filled category</li>
      <li>
        Properly filled strict parameters, especially category-specific ones
        like VIN
      </li>
      <li>
        At least 4 well-cropped photos formatted for search snippets with proper
        color correction
      </li>
      <li>Ideally, a product video</li>
      <li>At least 200 characters in the description</li>
      <li>Filled out contact methods</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Solution hypotheses</h2>
    <p>
      Based on the identified problems, our team brainstormed ideas to solve
      them. We developed two distinct approaches to working with UGC, which we
      ultimately combined into one.
