      Holistic journal that maps the structure of your life, revealing how your past, present, and future connect. It helps you see time and key metrics clearly so you can focus on what truly matters.

    <h2>Key idea</h2>
    <p>
      I’m building a universal self-design system that integrates <a href="/ld" class="link">the personal growth practices I use</a> into an AI-powered journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many of these practices. I’ve tested them on myself over the past ten years and will tell about each one separately. The problem is, they’re all scattered across different apps, so there’s no way to see the full history or long-term progress.
