    <h1 id="title">How I chose the name for my product</h1>
    <h2>
      Two months ago, I bought <a href="https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro" class="link" target="_blank">a reMarkable Paper Pro</a>. After years inside Apple’s comfortable ecosystem, I wanted to try something different: a device built for a calmer, more focused way to read, write, and design. Before that, I used an iPad for those same tasks, but often got sidetracked by the occasional mindless Fallout Shelter session.

    <h2>User experience: 9/10</h2>
    <p>This device is made for two things — reading and writing, and nothing else. No distractions, just the two jobs that actually matter to me. I love that. I take it everywhere now, instead of carrying a separate book and notebook.</p>
    <p>It loads slowly, you can almost feel it thinking under the hood. It’s annoying, but in a strange way, that delay grounds you. It sets the pace for calm, focused work. You stop rushing, stop switching. You just do one thing, thoughtfully.</p>

    <h2>Screen: 8/10</h2>
    <p>At first, it feels unusually dim, even at maximum brightness. Years of doomscrolling on OLEDs have probably burned my retina’s expectations.</p>
    <p>That said, it’s great for reading outside, even in bright sunlight, and surprisingly comfortable to read in bed at night.</p>
    <p>There are eight highlight colors besides black. All of them dull.</p>

    <h2>Writing experience: 9/10</h2>
    <p>Writing feels great, noticeably better than on the iPad. Of course, it’s still not paper, but the advantages are clear:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In paper notebooks I always write neat to save pages. Quick sketches end up on loose sheets anyway. They pile up, get lost, and are a pain to store.</li>
      <li>On the reMarkable, it feels good to make rough drafts and write messily. Everything stays saved, and there’s no fear of losing anything.</li>
      <li>There are several pen types, underlining options, an eraser on the back of the stylus, and handy gesture shortcuts.</li>
      <li>You can select and move written parts around when you realize something doesn’t fit.</li>
      <li>It recognizes handwritten English and some other languages, but not Russian (yet).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>File storage: 5/10</h2>
    <p>The system inside is pretty standard: you create folders inside folders inside more folders. There are tags, favorites, and filters for different e-book formats. It’s easy to use, but not great for building a knowledge base.</p>
    <p>
      My flow looks like this: I write on the tablet, then manually move the important notes into <a href="https://t.me/initsrightplace/215" class="link" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://t.me/initsrightplace/165" class="link" target="_blank">Notion</a>, or <a href="https://t.me/initsrightplace/223" class="link" target="_blank">my journal</a>. That’s also when I do the first round of editing. It works for me, writing and editing are two separate rhythms that don’t overlap.

    <h2>Battery: 6/10</h2>
    <p>The landing page promises two weeks of battery life. Mine lasts about eight days, maybe I got a faulty unit. Still, it’s definitely better than an iPad, but it feels like it could last longer.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Industrial design: 8/10</h2>
    <p>The tablet is solid, comfortable to hold, and good-looking.</p>
    <p>The ribbed edges, oddly placed power button, and smudge-prone cover are annoying.</p>
    <p>The pen looks worse than the iPad’s, but it works just fine.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Interface design: 10/10</h2>
    <p>Its brutal early-web aesthetic hits right in the nostalgia for anyone who remembers Web 1.0. Sharp squares without overused rounded corners, a monochrome beige palette, and electric blue accents.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>File sync: 5/10</h2>
    <p>There are apps for every platform. You drop a book onto your desktop, and it shows up on the tablet. Same with files.</p>
    <p>I’m currently on the trial plan. After three months, you either start paying or look for workarounds. Without a subscription, files older than 50 days don’t sync.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Page templates: 7/10</h2>
    <p>There are plenty to choose from — lined, grid, dotted, and even pre-formatted tables. Discovering them is surprisingly enjoyable.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Overall: 8/10</h2>
      <p>The reMarkable Paper Pro is a beautiful, well-designed device for reading and writing. It’s a bit overpriced, but I didn’t mind paying for something thoughtfully crafted in Norway.</p>
      <p>
        They’ve recently released <a href="https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro-move" class="link" target="_blank">a smaller, pocket-sized version</a>. The form factor feels a bit odd to me, though.
