    <h2>Looking for an interesting company to join</h2>
    <p>I’m back on the job market and actively looking for a company worth committing to.</p>
    <p>I’m a designer with 13 years of experience, including time leading teams. I think in products and businesses, I’m strong at turning ambiguity into structure, and I have a strong sense of aesthetics.</p>
    <p>My core interests are physical and mental health, productivity tools, and journaling. Areas where I’m ready to go deep and design something meaningful.</p>

    <h2>Working on the first prototype of my product Baselife</h2>
    <p>I finally started building my own product. Yay!</p>
    <p>
      I’ve conducted nine interviews with people who journal regularly. Their experiences have deepened my understanding, and I want to know even more about this topic. If you journal or practice mindfulness and productivity routines, I would love to learn about your experience. <a href="https://t.me/IngMaeSing" class="link" target="_blank"> Message me </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve also written <a href="/baselife" class="link">a page outlining the main idea</a>. It will definitely evolve during development, but I wanted to capture the overall picture early on, so nothing gets lost along the way. I’ll post project status updates there as well.
    </p>
    <p>Right now, I’ve got a logo and a color scheme. A good start, I’d say.</p>

    <h2>Using reMarkable Paper Pro</h2>
    <p>
      In early September, I sold my iPad and switched to an e-ink tablet. Now I read, write, and make quick sketches on it. It’s been a refreshing experience, slower and more focused. I wrote <a href="/remarkable" class="link"> a full review here </a>.

    <h2>Rebuilt my training routine</h2>
    <p>For a few months this year I was pushing through a program with four strength sessions and three cardio days a week. My body clearly couldn’t keep up. I kept getting sick and injured, but I refused to admit it and kept forcing myself forward.</p>
    <p>Therapy made me realize, that my capacity is finite and I need to listen to myself more carefully.</p>
    <p>So I rewired the program: three strength sessions and three cardio days. I still try to hit each muscle group twice a week and work within zones 2 and 5.</p>
    <p>Now I’m recovering on time, sleeping better, eating more. My weight has finally moved off the plateau.</p>

    <h2>Learning to focus on what matters</h2>
    <p>I spent a whole year using Opal to block distracting apps like Instagram on my iPhone and MacBook.</p>
    <p>In reality, I kept bypassing the blocks anyway, and even felt a weird sense of satisfaction from “outsmarting” the system.</p>
    <p>I finally deleted it. Now I’m working on changing the behavior itself. The more discipline and healthy habits I build, the less I feel the urge to drift into pointless distractions.</p>

    <h2>Done with active dating</h2>
    <p>For a couple of years I was deep into dating apps — matching, chatting, going on dates.</p>
    <p>At some point I realized I was exhausted and not getting anything meaningful out of it. Now I chose to focus on myself instead. That decision gave me back a solid chunk of energy.</p>
    <p>I believe whatever’s meant for me will show up on its own.</p>

    <h2>Started antidepressants</h2>
    <p>I’ve been in therapy for four years. Even longer than that, I suspected something wasn’t quite working as it should.</p>
    <p>I was recently diagnosed with a mild anxiety disorder and prescribed antidepressants. I’ve started taking them and am noticing the first effects. They didn’t make me happier. But my head feels quieter, and it’s become easier to direct my attention toward what I actually want to do.</p>
    <p>I’ll keep observing my state and building discipline.</p>
