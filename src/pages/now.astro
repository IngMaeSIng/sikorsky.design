    <h2>Joined T-Bank</h2>
    <p>
      I’d been applying to interesting positions and going through interviews for almost a year. Here’s the overall tally: <strong>72 applications</strong>, <strong>8 HR screenings</strong>, <strong> 11 technical interviews</strong>, <strong>1 whiteboard session</strong>, <strong>1 test assignment</strong>, and finally <strong> 1 offer</strong>. I obviously missed my initial three-month deadline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unexpectedly, a great role found me on its own. In October, I started as a <strong>Staff Product Designer</strong>
      at <strong>T-Bank</strong>, joining the <strong>Design Evolution team</strong>. I’ll be focusing on creating bold concepts and pushing forward emotional design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll write a separate reflection on how my year and a half of sabbatical went, and about the new job as well. Follow me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulsikorsky/" class="link" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a> for updates.

    <h2>Working on the first prototype of my product Baseline</h2>
    <p>I finally started building my own product. Yay!</p>
    <p>
      I’ve conducted nine interviews with people who journal regularly. Their experiences have deepened my understanding, and I want to know even more about this topic. If you journal or practice mindfulness and productivity routines, I would love to learn about your experience. <a href="https://t.me/IngMaeSing" class="link" target="_blank"> Message me </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve also written <a href="/baseline" class="link">a page outlining the main idea</a>. It will definitely evolve during development, but I wanted to capture the overall picture early on, so nothing gets lost along the way. I’ll post project status updates there as well.
    </p>
    <p>Right now, I’ve got a logo and a color scheme. A good start, I’d say.</p>

    <h2>Using reMarkable Paper Pro</h2>
    <p>
      In early September, I sold my iPad and switched to an e-ink tablet. Now I read, write, and make quick sketches on it. It’s been a refreshing experience, slower and more focused. I wrote <a href="/remarkable" class="link"> a full review here </a>.

    <h2>Rebuilt my training routine</h2>
    <p>For a few months this year I was pushing through a program with four strength sessions and three cardio days a week. My body clearly couldn’t keep up. I kept getting sick and injured, but I refused to admit it and kept forcing myself forward.</p>
    <p>Therapy made me realize, that my capacity is finite and I need to listen to myself more carefully.</p>
    <p>So I rewired the program: three strength sessions and three cardio days. I still try to hit each muscle group twice a week and work within zones 2 and 5.</p>
    <p>Now I’m recovering on time, sleeping better, eating more. My weight has finally moved off the plateau.</p>

    <h2>Learning to focus on what matters</h2>
    <p>I spent a whole year using Opal to block distracting apps like Instagram on my iPhone and MacBook.</p>
    <p>In reality, I kept bypassing the blocks anyway, and even felt a weird sense of satisfaction from “outsmarting” the system.</p>
    <p>I finally deleted it. Now I’m working on changing the behavior itself. The more discipline and healthy habits I build, the less I feel the urge to drift into pointless distractions.</p>

    <h2>Done with active dating</h2>
    <p>For a couple of years I was deep into dating apps — matching, chatting, going on dates.</p>
    <p>At some point I realized I was exhausted and not getting anything meaningful out of it. Now I chose to focus on myself instead. That decision gave me back a solid chunk of energy.</p>
    <p>I believe whatever’s meant for me will show up on its own.</p>

    <h2>Microdosing amanita</h2>
    <p>Since August I’ve been microdosing amanita mushrooms. I started with the red one, now I’m trying panther.</p>
    <p>The effect showed up right away, even though people say it should come on gradually. I’m sure some of it is placebo, but it still works for me.</p>
    <p>My anxiety and low moods have almost disappeared. Most days I feel steady, even quietly upbeat. I have the energy and desire to create new things.</p>
    <p>That's what I do now.</p>
