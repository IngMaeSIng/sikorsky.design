    <p>I believe in this idea almost like it’s a form of salvation. But there was always something stopping me.</p>
    <p>I need to research competitors. I need to talk to potential users. I need to map the entire production roadmap.</p>
    <p>My favorite form of procrastination is writing an extremely detailed to-do list, and then feeling overwhelmed by how massive it looks.</p>
    <p>The solution turned out to be obvious. Just start.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of a new project, frameworks can become a hiding place. Sometimes you have to ignore the “proper” way and build the messy first version. If it feels right, you’ll refine it later.</p>
    <p>Building for yourself is already powerful. At minimum, you have a market of one. But what truly drives me as a designer is when other people use something I created.</p>
    <p>So now I’m working on positioning and trying to understand who the Life Calendar could genuinely serve.</p>
    <p>I replaced “default life” with four specific archetypes, each with tension and a defining turning point in the current year. I wanted realism, so there’s a balance between light and shadow.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sense Architect</strong> → actively designs their life. Learns that control is an illusion.</li>
      <li><strong>High Performer</strong> → burns for their work. Realizes achievement doesn’t equal meaning.</li>
      <li><strong>Pivot Seeker</strong> → constantly searching. Understands that movement can be avoidance.</li>
      <li><strong>Embodied Practitioner</strong> → integrates experience. Sees that healing requires accepting your wounds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI tools helped me test the positioning on synthetic respondents. Useful approximation. Now I’m curious about <a href="https://t.me/IngMaeSing" class="link" target="_blank">feedback</a> from real humans.</p>
